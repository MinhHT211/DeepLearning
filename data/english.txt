According to Paula Grayson, it's better to pay people this way.
Laziness, debauchery and excessive drinking unfortunately took their toll, leaving the mother frozen to death among her miserable children.
In a drunken stupor, the mother fell right on the doorstep, and died before the eyes of her frightened little children.
Most of the men, women and children in the village despised, mocked, and angrily threatened this woman; but now, when the news of her death had spread by word of mouth, in hushed voices, pity replaced anger, and sadness replaced threats.
Neighbors rushed to the dilapidated shack, where, in addition to shelter from the summer heat and winter cold, the mother had kept some shrouds for a decent burial; and some food for the three starving children.
John, the eldest, a stout twelve-year-old, could have made a living with any farmhand.
Two years ago, a fall from a window had damaged her spine, and since then she had not been able to get out of bed unless her mother held her in her arms.
The important question was, "What to do with the children?"
